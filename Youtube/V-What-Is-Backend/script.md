# What is Backend?

- When we visit [_youtube.com_](http://youtube.com/) we are greeted by this beautiful homepage with a bunch of videos that we can choose from.
- These videos are not random. In fact, youtube is smart enough to show you videos that you are most likely to click on, based on your watch history. This is the Youtube algorithm.
- In the previous video we talked about Frontend, and Frontend Developers are not really involved in such development of mindblowing algorithms. Frontend developers are only getting data from the server and they use these data to display it in a more aesthetically appealing approach, rather than just plain texts.
- Backend developers on the other hand are developers who are responsible for creating these data that the frontend developers can use, but itâ€™s not as easy as it may sound.
- Backend is complex.
- Backend is where all the magic is happening.
- I'm talking about:
  - Request handling
  - Routing
  - Authentication
  - Caching
  - External Services integration
  - Database Interations
  - and in Backend is where the algorithim of Youtube lives.
- And for you to really understand what i'm talking about, here is a very basic example (go to tutorial directory)
